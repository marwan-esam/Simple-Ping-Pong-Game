# Simple-Ping-Pong-Game
A game developed using the GLUT library in C++

- This is a simple Ping Pong game that was developed by Marwan Esam
- The game simply consists of 2 players playing against each other. The player who scores 11 goals wins, simple.
- The controls: for the player on the left press 'w' to go up and 's' to go down (case insensitive),
and for the player on the right press "the arrow pointing to the top" to go up and "the arrow pointing to the bottom" to do down.
- while you are playing, the game gets more difficult as the ball starts to move faster if non of you is winningXD
- press the "esc" button if you want to exit the game.
this is pretty much the game, enjoy:)
